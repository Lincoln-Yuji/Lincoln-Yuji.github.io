As someone still interested to keep contributing to the Linux
ecossystem, but not really into contrubting to the kernel itself,
there are a lot of ways we can help to build this empire apart from
the kernel.

One of these ways is to help the development of tools some Linux
developers use, such as kworkflow. I've decided to keep working
and cotributing to kworkflow because I am a big fan of shell scripts
as tools to automate tasks for our desktop and workflow environments
and, even though I'm not a Linux developer myself, I do believe
that Linux plays a massive important role for us nowadays and I
want to keep learning and contributing to this amazing ecossystem.

# Next steps with kworkflow

Since we have already made previous contributions to kw, we already
have a basic understanding of project's structure, workflow and
contribution process. On this blog post I will focus more on the
feature itself, explaining how it works and every addition/change
I made to integrate a full new feature.

The motivation to start this contribution was the [issue #83](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/issues/83).
