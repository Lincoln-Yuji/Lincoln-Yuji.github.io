Since this is my first blog post talking about something specific
to Debian, I belive introducing it first is a good a idea.

Debian is a Free Open-Source Linux distribution that is known
for its stability, security and extensive software repository.
It is actively developed by a community-driven workflow, which
emphasizes its open-source principles.

# Package Management

You probably have already heard about Debian's package manager called
`APT` (Advanced Package Tool). It's a complex system responsible for
managing a massive set of repositories and software packages, making
it easy for the users to do basic things like installing, udpadating
and removing software in their machines.

# Why and how to contribute with packages for Debian?

There are several reasons to why contribute, but the main one is that
not only Debian, but a lot of Linux distributions that branch out from it
such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint are largely used in commercial fields and
backend servers. Debian plays a huge role in our lives nowadays and
multiple systems are built on top of a Debian "core".

Regarding how we can contribute, if you have any software that you would
like to make it more easily accessible to other people then this is
already a good start. How you create and publish this package to be
downloadable by `apt` is something that we should take a better look at.

In particular, we'll be using these great tutorials made by **Joenio Marques da Costa**:

- [Parte 1: Tutorial de empacotamento Debian](https://joenio.me/tutorial-pacote-debian-parte1/)

- [Parte 2: Criando o seu pr√≥prio pacote Debian](https://joenio.me/tutorial-pacote-debian-parte2/)

I'll try to focus more on my experience while doing these tutorial and
lessons I learned. But of course, I'll be showing the steps I followed as well and
do my best to explain how I followed these tutorials.

# Installing Debian Testing

The recommended version of Debian to work with packages is the **Testing** version. It has
a nice balance between **Unstable** and **Stable**. The installer can be found
[here](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/).

We don't need ay sort of insane setup to start working with packaging software for Debian.
We can simply use a virtual machine to install and run the operating system.

I decided to use `libvirt` via [virt manager](https://virt-manager.org/) to install
Debian Testing and start working on this task.

We also don't need an installation with too much stuff. A very basic and raw Debian
installation is enough. Any additional software can be installed after we have
the system operating and running.

# Configuring a development environment for Debian Packages

First of all, we should be able to access our Debian VM. We can do that by opening
the Virtual Machine via `virt manager`, but I would rather work on this from the
Host Machine via SSH.

Having Debian Testing working in a virtual machine, we start doing some
preparations. First of all, ensure we have **ssh-server** enabled and running
in the VM's Debian:

```bash
# @vm
$ sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
$ sudo systemctl enable sshd
```

You can check the VM's public IP by running `ip a` in the command line.

Alternatively, with the Debian VM running, check its IP by using the following commands
in the Host Machine's command line:

```sh
# @host
$ virsh net-list  # This command will prompt the used network name
$ virsh net-dhcp-leases <network-name>
```

Now we can access the VM through ssh:

```bash
# @host
$ ssh <username>@<VM-public-IP-address>
```

Enter your password, type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**. From now
on, every command will be executed inside the `@vm`.

Now we can start installing some useful development tools to work with the packaging process:

```bash
$ sudo apt install devscripts debhelper debian-policy git-buildpackage pkg-perl-tools
```

You should also install `apt-file` and update your data base so `dh-make-perl` can
find Debian packages referred by some Perl library:

```bash
$ sudo apt install apt-file
$ sudo apt-file update
```

Next it's recommended to configure your `git` so all the dev tools can properly set
the correct information when installing any sort of template and make your
**git log** information more meaningful.

```bash
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

The tool `dh-make-perl` also uses some variables to correctly fill some fields
inside the `debian/` directory with data when you install the repository:

```bash
$ export EMAIL=you@example.com
$ export DEBFULLNAME="Your Name"
```

You can write those line inside `~/.bash_profile` so it automatically sets these
variables whenever the system restarts.

Finally, if this is the **first time** you are using `cpan`, you must run the following
command **before** running `dh-make-perl` so we have all the base configuration ready
to go.

```bash
$ cpan
```

# Creating package for the Perl library Hash::Wrap

**Important: check if the library you chose is not a Debian Package already!**

```bash
$ dh-make-perl locate Hash::Wrap
== dh-make-perl 0.124 ==
Parsing Contents files:
	ll.lz4
	md64.lz4
Hash::Wrap is not found in any Debian package
```

This is where we start diverging from the tutorial. Of course we don't want to use
the Hello World library because it does not provide ny real utility apart from
learning how packages are structured in Debian.

And, again, it's important to choose a library that is not a Debian package yet.
At the time this blog post is published, this lirary will already be in a Debian
package probably and the reader will have to choose another library to work with.

However, keep in mind that you can use any library of your interest to create
packages for Debian. Don't feel limited by the few option the tutorial shows you.

Our next step is to create the first version of our package. This can be done by
executing the following commands. They will download and install the code from
the **upstream** and setup some template files inside `debian/`:

```bash
$ mkdir hash_wrap_pack && cd hash_wrap_pack
$ dh-make-perl --pkg-perl --cpan Hash::Wrap
```

This created a new directory, along with a `tar` file, named `libhash-wrap-perl`.
You can just `cd` into this directory and start working with the package.

# First base changes

For this package in particular, and actually most packages you will work with,
you need to check three files in `debian/` and see if everything is ok:
`copyright`, `control` and `changelog`. 

### debian/copyright:

Check for the copyrights of the pacages with the following commands:

```bash
$ grep -i -r --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=debian copyright
$ licensecheck --shortname-scheme=debian,spdx --copyright --recursive .
$ scan-copyrights
```

They will help you find the copyright information you need without having to check
all the files inside the repository. After using those commands, we've checked that
the copyright information was incomplete and we need to re-organize some other
stuff in the file.

The final result is this:

![debian/copyright](/assets/img/debian_package_tutorial/debian_copyright.png)

Then you can remove the **DISCLAIMER** message, then commit these changes and
you are good to go.

### debian/control:

At the moment this blog was in production, the policy we should use for
`Standards-Version` inside `control` is **4.7.0** and the version
`debhelper-compat` is **13**.

However, those changes were not necessary because the base configuration
we received from `dh-make-perl` didn't mess this up, but keep in mind that
you might have to chage this with other packages.

You can use the following command to check `Standards-Version` and
`debheper-compat`'s version, respectively:

```bash
$ dpkg-query --show --showformat '${Version}\n' debian-policy
$ rmadison --suite=unstable debhelper | cut -d"|" -f 2 | sed 's/\s\+//'
```

Often you will need to update the **Description** because `dh-make-perl`
uses the description from the upstream to write it onto the file. However,
this description is usually not good enough to keep in this file. It's
bery likely will have to change it to something more meaningful.

The final result of our changes was this:

![debian/control](/assets/img/debian_package_tutorial/debian_control.png)

Check if everything is ok with this file:

```bash
$ cme check dpkg-control debian/control
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
```

If no further changes are needed you can just commit this file and proceed
to the following steps.

### debian/changelog

Before changing this file, we should check if our package so far is
correctly set up. To do so, we can just build it and run `litian` to
check if everything is ok:

```bash
$ sudo pbuilder create
$ sudo pbuilder update
```

This will build the package and ensure it's updated. Now, with a new version
built of the package, we should ensure we have all the dependencies installed
by running:

```bash
$ BUILDER=pbuilder git-pbuilder
```

Finally, we check if our packages is fine by using lintian:

```bash
$ lintian -I --profile pkg-perl --info
```

In particular, with this package, we get a warning which says: `initial-upload-closes-no-bugs`.
This is something we will fix by opening an **ITP** report and updating our
changelog file.

Now we can run some development tests and check if our packages successfully
passes them all:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools # Contains dev tests
$ sudo adduser <username> sbuild        # Allows you to run without root
$ mk-sbuild sid                         # Creates a chroot i.e. sid-amd64
$ autopkgtest . -- schroot sid-amd64    # Builds and tests with the chroot created
```

After that, you should check the last lines and see something like:

```
All tests successful.
...
autodep8-perl-recommends PASS (superficial)
```

That means our package is fine and we can upload it. But, before that,
remember that we have to open an **ITP** report and update our changelog.

To do so, we need to send an email to `submit@bugs.debian.org`.
The subject and content of the email can be extracted by running:

```bash
$ dpt gen-itp > /tmp/mail
$ cat /tmp/mail 
```

Use any email client to send it. After some minutes, you will receive a response
like so:

![ITP bug report](/assets/img/debian_package_tutorial/debian_itp_bug_code_mail.png)

The bug report was created. This one in particular can be accessed through
[this link](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1071516).

With this task done, we can update our `debian/changelog` file:

```bash
$ dch --closes 1071516 # Updates changelog message to close this bug
$ dch --release        # Switch 'unreleased' to 'unstable' status
```

This was the result:

![debian/changelog](/assets/img/debian_package_tutorial/itp_updated_changelog.png)

Commit those changes and we can proceed to the next steps.

# Preparations to upload the package

We need to create a Salsa account first. A moderator will check if everything is ok
and then accept your registration into Salsa. Keep in mind that this can take some hours
or even days.

After getting your account accepted, you need to **associate an SSH key to your profile in Salsa Gitlab**.

Note that this SSH key needs to be an SSH key configured inside the machine we are working with
the package, that is, inside the Virtual Machine.

These are the steps I did to set up an SSH key in the Debian VM and associate to my Salsa profile.

Generate the SSH key using the `ed25519` algorithm:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Then start the `ssh-agent` in the background:

```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Add your private key to the agent:

```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now you can just copy and paste the content from `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` into Salsa Gitlab
when associating a new SSH key to your profile. Note that you do this with your public key, not
the private one.

After all this we can upload packages to Salsa Gitlab with no headaches or additional authentications.

# Uploading the package to Debian Perl's team repository

First of all, we need to join the Perl's Team. We can do that by sending them an
email with a small intorduction and our Salsa username. The email I've sent can
be found here:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2024/06/msg00000.html
