As I recently got my new job at Management Solutions, I got allocated to a project
where we are responsible for developing and maintaining a big set of applications
based in DevOps principles of workflows and infrastructure.

In this blog post, I'll be focusing on the tecnologies I've been studying and
learning in the past few months. However, I don't want this to be just a presentention
of names and definitions. I'll simply share some basic architectural ideas and get into
some small practical examples in order to show how basic concepts and principles can
take us to start working in larger and much more robust projects.

# 1. A Quarkus application

# Containerizing the application using Docker

# 2. Creating a Kubernetes Cluster

## 2.1. Deployment

## 2.2. Service

## 2.3. Ingress

# 3. Using Github Actions for CI (Continuous Integration)

# 4. Using ArgoCD for CD (Continuous Delievery)
